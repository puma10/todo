					I'm trying to calculate if I should become a w2 employee or continue receiving the salary to my corporation instead. The amount is $250k a year.

					Upside of w2 is I don't pay self employment tax I guess and get contribution to a 401k as well as health insurance benefits of about $12k per year.

					Upside of taking it to the s-corp is I can do a solo 401k and offset costs.

					I have about $60k that comes in from a side business unrelated to this regardless.
