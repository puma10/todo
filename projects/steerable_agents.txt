Memory 
    R2R (Best for your "Unlimited Docs")
            R2R is designed to build a Knowledge Graph from your data. This is the "true" GraphRAG you likely need for complex topics.

            The Engine: R2R natively integrates a specialized open-source model called Triplex. This model is trained specifically to extract "knowledge triples" (Entity A -> Relationship -> Entity B) from unstructured text.

            The Advantage: Building knowledge graphs usually requires expensive models like GPT-4. R2R's Triplex model reduces this cost by 98%, allowing you to turn thousands of local documents into a graph without a massive API bill or sending data to OpenAI.

            Capability: It enables "Global Search." Instead of just finding a specific keyword (Vector Search), R2R can answer high-level questions like "What are the conflicting arguments across these 50 papers?" by traversing the relationships it built between documents.
    
    Mem0 (Best for "User Context")
        Mem0 uses Graph Memory primarily to map you and your interactions.

        The Engine: Mem0 extracts entities from your conversations (not necessarily your static files) to map relationships between users, agents, and session topics.

        Kiln: https://kiln.tech/ 
            simple just to understand ops but no observability so can't understand how routing gets lost 
                Just eval process and developing an LLM as judge

        Mlflow - https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow
            Looks simple, self hosted, has tracing 
        Built your own "Harness"
            but don't understand how the full sytem works

    3 strategies he recommends together
        Reranking
        Agentic Rag 
        Context aware chunking 

    Tools he recommends
        file extraction and chunking Docling
        Website - crawl4AI
        Postgres (w/ pgvector) - slower then dedicated.  Needs a regular database as well
        Mem0 - Longterm Memory. Just a different type of Rag
        Knowledge Graph (2 parts): https://youtu.be/21_k2St8bBI?t=974
            good for link builder                
            Neo 4J Graph Database - not totally open source for commercial. 
                where store and visualize the data 
                Alternatives falkorDB and Memgraph
                
            
            Graphiti Knowledge Graph Framework
                where we create the entities 
                insert and search our data
                    different entities and maps how they relate 
                    needs an llm to extract

    Query strategies 
        renanker - pull relevant chunks: 
        Agentic rag - chose between retrevial tools 
            chunks, semantic search, full doc
            flexible, adapts to query automatically 
            more complex - less predicatlbe behavior
        Knowledge graph - graphiti
            graph database - great for interconnected data
            more expnesive 
        Contextual retrieval
            adds context to the chunk 
            35-50% improvement
            expensive 
        Query Expansion
            expand the query more specific 
            one llm call per search so slower 
        Multi Query Rag 
            Comperehensive coverage, better recall on ambigious queries 
            4x databae queries though in parallel (though parallized), higher cost
    
    Data Preperation 
        Context Aware Chunking 
            to find the natural boundries 
            free, fast, maintains document structure
            slightly more complex than naive chunking
            use docling 
        Late Chunking 
            complex - need to watch more if it's a problem

        Hiearchical Rag
            Oarent-child chunk relationships 
                Search small chunks for precision, terurn large parent chunks for context
        
        Self reflective rag
            Self-correcting search loop:
                Perform initial search - llm grades relevance 1-5
                If less then 3 refine query and search again 
                costs more llm calls

        Fine-tuned embeddings
            Train an embedding modls on domain specific query-document pais to improve retrieeval accuracy for specailized domains (legal, finance etc)
            5-10% accuracy gains, smaller models can outperform larger generic ones
            requires training data, infrastructure, ongoing maintenance
            example - can align sentiment more https://cln.sh/hpdjDbW8
                pretraind: shipping was fast and orders was late is similar 
                fintuned: shipping was fast, order arrived on time (positive sentiment)
