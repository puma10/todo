	Questions
		How much does harsha have in there that's non operational?
		What percentage of your gross income comes from passive sources like crypto? If passive income (from crypto or other investments) is less than 75% of total gross income, the company likely passes the income test. But if crypto gains are significant, it could push you over the threshold.

		If the total value of passive assets (cash, crypto, etc.) exceeds 50% of the average value of all assets, the company fails the asset test and is a PFIC.

	PFIC Needs to be managed annually 
	
	QEF
		Qualified Election Fund

		pro rata % (proportioanl to your ownership)
		You must pay tax annually on your share of the PFIC's earnings (including unrealized gains), even if no cash is distributed to you. 
		This requires you to have funds available to cover the tax liability.

		

	PFIC with QEF Election (your foreign corporation earns short-term gains)
		- The PFIC's short-term gains are passed through to you as "net capital gains" and taxed at long-term capital gains rates (0%, 15%, or 20%).	Preferential LTCG rates (e.g., 15% for many taxpayers).


	FBAR 
		not an IRS form; it is a Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) report filed with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN),
		You generally do not file an FBAR for the corporation's bank accounts simply because you are a 20% shareholder.
			Signature Authority: If you have signature authority over any of the corporation's bank accounts (meaning you can control the disposition of assets in the account by direct communication with the financial institution), you must report those specific accounts on an FBAR, even though the money isn't yours.
		You do not need to file with your personal 
		more than 50%
