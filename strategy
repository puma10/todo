Artsmart
    [x] Open the product and give ads for revenue. No revenue too low 
        improve the app quickly and integrate all new models
			start trying to migrate to next.js - app setup locally
				try to make a canvas
    

Shotsmart
    Appsumo 
        To launch it we need to run the engine to understand costs 
        calculate the value
    
    Run own ltd? 
        We have the page - run ads?

    Try switch Next.js (on a branch)
        Kind of worked - do iterations of the UI.
		Maybe wait until gemini 3 with good css to rewriet less code?


Cost Segregation 
    see where they are getting their traffic 
    plays the real estate side
    can see if we get distribution before too much app
